        In the playground section, there is a counter, with subtracting and adding buttons. There is 
        also a to-do list that displays the items that you want to input into the box in order to keep
        track of what you need to do. The bored section gives you list of activities and details about it
        everytime you feel bored.

      <h3>How I made it</h3>
      <p>
        The playground section comprises of a counter and to-do list. The counter works by having two buttons 
        display a "counter", with a subtract/add button. These buttons work by having an event listener 
        that waits until there is a click on one of these buttons. And the corresponding action ensues
        once it receives that click, and the count-display, which is the id of the counter, updates a local variable
        accordingly. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        The to-do list backend starts with an input text box generated in html. This is linked to a 
        javascript component, that has an event listener for the submit button. It takes whatever is inputted 
        into the input, and creates a local var task that is of type li, assigns it to this input 
        and is appended to the ul as a child. 

        <br> 
        <br> 
        The bored button utilizes an asynchronous model where there is a function that fetches data 
        from the Bored API, in the form of a json. Then, that json object is parsed iteratively with a 
        key, value. A paragraph called detail is created with the corresponding key, value pair
        and appended as a child to the info card.
